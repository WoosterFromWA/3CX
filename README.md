# 3CX
hotkey for easily switching to 3CX and getting ready for number input

## 3CX Script
This is a compiled [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/ "AutoHotKey's Homepage") script that makes it easy to switch to 3CX.

Simply press CTRL+ALT+\ (the one above the Enter key) to switch to the open 3CX window and clear any existing number and get ready to input a number.

__Dude Edition__ uses F12 instead for this command is designed to work on a 1920x1080 display with 125% scaline.

### New Functionality
Ability to copy-paste text into 3CX. Same restrictions apply (see below)

__Usage__
+ Click in a number field in GM
+ Press _F11_

Make sure to have 3CX running or you'll get an error message

Also, a real limitation is that it must be on the screen that allows direct number entry:
